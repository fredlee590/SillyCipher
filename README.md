SillyCipher
===========

SillyCipher is a simple command line tool to demonstrate Vigenere ciphers on strings and files. The Vigenere ciphers are generated from a
user-input keyword (for fun and profit!).

Requires package libssl-dev to compile.

Compile and install with

```
make
sudo make install
```

From there, see `sillyCipher --help` for full detail and options.
